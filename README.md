> Back in 2015 i worked with a small team on an interactive chat application, the initial version was in ionic + firebase, then i remade the all application in react native + firebase, due to some problems the application was never released, here is another unfinished website i made for the application at the time, unfortunately i can't release source for the mobile application as i don't own the rights, check the [link](https://sangloo.github.io/umood.github.io/)  or watch the .gif
